# Architecture of a Seeing-eye Application

This code base is for an Android Application called 'Rekognition.' Developed by Will Song, Tom Nguyen, and myself, this application allows users to take pictures and have any text or objects detected in the image read aloud to them. This is intended to be used by those with vision impairments.

## Top level architecture of the application:
